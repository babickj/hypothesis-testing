When you can run a Z Test:

Several different types of tests are used in statistics (i.e. f test, chi square test, t test). You would use a Z test if:
1. Your sample size is greater than 30. Otherwise, use a t test.
2. Data points should be independent from each other. In other words, one data point isn’t related or doesn’t affect another data point.
3. Your data should be normally distributed. However, for large sample sizes (over 30) this doesn’t always matter.
4. Your data should be randomly selected from a population, where each item has an equal chance of being selected.
5. Sample sizes should be equal if at all possible.
